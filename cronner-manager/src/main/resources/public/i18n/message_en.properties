placeholder-cron=The cron expression for the job start time
placeholder-sharding-total-count=Sharding total count
placeholder-job-parameter-cronner=You can configure multiple identical jobs, but use different parameters as different scheduling instances
placeholder-reconcile-interval-minutes=Fix the error-state job server scan repair cycle. The configuration is -1 indicating that the fix action is not enabled.
placeholder-monitor-execution=Each job execution time and interval time is very short, suggest not to monitor homework runtime state in order to enhance efficiency, because it is a transient state, so no need to monitor. Users will be asked to increase their own data accumulation monitoring. There is no guarantee that the data will be repeated, which should be achieved in the operation. It also fails to implement the job failure transfer. It is recommended that the monitoring operation should be monitored at the time of the operation and the interval time.
placeholder-failover=Whether open task execution failure, open said if the job tasks performed in a halfway down, allowing the time unfinished task on the node of another job compensation is carried out.
placeholder-misfire=Whether the task is open misses the reexecution
placeholder-streaming-process=If the data is processed, fetch data will not return empty results and will continue to perform the work. If the data is not flowing, the data is processed and the job is finished
placeholder-sharding-item-parameters=Separate serial Numbers and parameters are separated by equals, and multiple key values are separated by commas, similar to map. The serial serial Numbers start from 0, not greater than or equal to the total number of assignments. For example, 0 = a, 1 = b, 2 = c
placeholder-job-sharding-strategy-class=By default, you can customize the share-chip strategy based on IP address sequentially
placeholder-job-exception-handler=Extension 'JobExceptionHandler' interface, custom exception handling process, the default implementation is log but not throw an exception.
